# Welcome to TicTacApp!

Hi! I have build this app using TypeScript, Webpack and babel.

It is a simple Tic Tac Toe game. It is a two player game. You can play with your friend or play with another online random person if any available. You can play against Computer program and also against LLM model. It is a simple game but it is fun to play.

It works same as modern JS framework and adds everything to index.html through JS.
